# Web Research

Use this approach for questions that require thorough web research.

## When to Use

- User asks a complex factual question
- User wants a comparison or analysis of multiple sources
- User needs current information about a topic

## Procedure

1. **Break down the query** into 2-3 specific search queries
2. **Search each query** using webSearch with `depth: "advanced"` for complex topics
3. **Cross-reference results** — look for agreement across sources
4. **Synthesize** findings into a clear, concise answer
5. **Cite sources** — mention where key facts came from

## Guidelines

- Prefer recent sources over older ones
- Note when sources disagree
- Distinguish between facts and opinions
- If results are thin, try rephrasing the search query
- Store key findings in memory if the user might ask follow-up questions
