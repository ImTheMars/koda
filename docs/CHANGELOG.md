### v1.3.1 — MCP stdio transport + auto-restart

extends the MCP client with stdio transport support for local servers and automatic reconnection on failure.

#### added

- **stdio MCP transport** — `mcp.servers` now accepts `transport: "stdio"` entries with `command`, `args`, and `env` fields. enables local MCP servers (filesystem, git, puppeteer, etc.) without running a separate HTTP/SSE server.
- **MCP auto-restart** — a 60 s health-check interval calls `client.tools()` on each connected server. on failure it closes the old client, waits 2 s, and reconnects, re-merging tools into the live ToolSet. opt out per-server with `autoRestart: false`.
- **`autoRestart` config field** — all three server variants (`sse`, `http`, `stdio`) accept an optional `autoRestart: boolean` (default `true`).

#### changed

- **`mcp.servers` schema** — migrated from a flat object to a `z.discriminatedUnion("transport", [...])`. each variant is fully typed: `sse`/`http` keep `url` + optional `headers`; `stdio` has `command` + optional `args`/`env`.
- **`buildMcpTransport()` + `connectMcpServer()`** — MCP boot logic extracted into two helper functions in `src/index.ts`. removes the `as any` cast on the transport object.
- **config.example.json** — `mcp.servers` now shows a stdio (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`) and an sse example instead of an empty array.

### v1.3.0 — auto-learning, MCP, streaming, hardening

major release. replaces the local learnings system with Supermemory's native user profiles and conversation ingestion, adds MCP client support, switches Telegram to streamText for real-time segment delivery, adds a system status tool, and hardens SQLite and the LLM pipeline.

#### added

- **supermemory user profiles** — `getProfile()` fetches static user facts, dynamic context, and query-specific memories from Supermemory at each request. structured profile replaces the flat learnings table in the system prompt.
- **conversation ingestion** — after every exchange, messages are fire-and-forget sent to `supermemory.conversations.ingestOrUpdate()`. Supermemory auto-extracts facts and updates the user profile. zero extra LLM cost.
- **supermemory filter prompt** — one-time boot setup via `client.settings.update()` configures Supermemory to filter ingested content for personal facts, corrections, and preferences. state-keyed so it only runs once.
- **entity context** — `setupEntityContext()` sets per-user entity context on first interaction so Supermemory knows what kind of facts to focus on.
- **MCP client support** — define external MCP servers in `config.json` under `mcp.servers`. each server is connected at boot and its tools are merged into the global tool set. failing servers are skipped without blocking boot.
- **system status tool** — `systemStatus` tool reports uptime, memory usage, Supermemory health, LLM circuit breaker state, today's usage stats, and next scheduled task. answers "how are you doing?" with real system info.
- **streamText for Telegram** — text and photo messages now use `streamAgent()` backed by `streamText`. segments are sent as they complete (delimited by `<|msg|>`), so users see responses faster instead of waiting for the full completion.
- **SQLite migration system** — `runMigrations()` tracks `schema_version` in the `state` table and runs schema changes on boot. starts at version 1.

#### changed

- **learnings → supermemory profiles** — `getMemories` dep replaced by `getProfile` in `AgentDeps`. local learnings table is retained but no longer written to.
- **totalUsage for cost tracking** — switched from `result.usage` to `result.totalUsage` for accurate multi-step cost when models escalate mid-conversation.
- **Grammy error handling** — `bot.catch()` now differentiates `GrammyError` (bad API request, log and continue) vs `HttpError` (network failure, track and restart) vs unknown errors.
- **SQLite pragmas** — added `PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL` (safe with WAL, faster writes) and `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000` (retry on SQLITE_BUSY instead of failing).
- **MCP config schema** — `config.ts` and `config.example.json` updated with `mcp.servers` array. removed stale `timeouts.browser` field.
- **`@supermemory/tools` + `@ai-sdk/mcp` installed** — added to package.json.

#### fixed

- **emoji appended to every message** — removed emoji decorators from all soul.d headers (`🐻‍❄️`, `🛡️`, `🐾`). removed "polar bear on ice" metaphors from `soul.md`. added explicit no-emoji rule to `response.md`: "never end messages with emojis. no 🧊, no 🐻‍❄️, no emoji signatures."
- **`result.chunk` search results dropped** — recall now reads both `r.memory` and `r.chunk` from Supermemory search results. document chunk hits were previously silently dropped.

#### removed

- **`CORRECTION_PATTERN` regex + auto-correction capture** — removed from agent.ts. Supermemory ingestion handles correction extraction automatically.
- **`learnings` dependency from agent.ts** — `dbLearnings.getRecent()` and `dbLearnings` import removed from agent context building.
- **`isMemoryDegraded` dep** — folded into `getProfile` returning empty arrays on circuit break.

### v1.2.0 — leaner runtime + multimodal fixes

focuses on removing low-value surface area, fixing image handling, and tightening runtime reliability.

#### removed

- **stagehand browser tools** — removed `src/tools/browser.ts` and `@browserbasehq/stagehand` dependency to reduce runtime size and optional complexity.
- **heartbeat file loop** — removed HEARTBEAT.md polling/parsing from proactive jobs; scheduler is now the only proactive mechanism.
- **unused memory deletion path** — removed `deleteMemory` tool and provider delete method.
- **dead db API** — removed `messages.rewrite()` from the sqlite layer.

#### fixed

- **photo understanding** — telegram photo handler now downloads the image and passes base64 image attachments to the agent for multimodal responses.
- **usage accounting** — token cost now uses the actual response model id (including failover) instead of assumed tier model.
- **typing race** — typing indicator is now ref-counted per chat to avoid concurrent request collisions.
- **exec memory growth** — capped process stdout/stderr buffers and added cleanup for completed process entries.

#### changed

- **response formatting** — telegram now sends html-formatted messages instead of stripping markdown; links/code/bold are preserved.
- **message delimiter** — switched multi-message delimiter from `|||` to `<|msg|>` across agent and channels.
- **fast-tier optimization** — fast chat requests skip heavy memory/skills/learnings context fetch for lower latency and cost.
- **routing behavior** — short tool-hint prompts can stay on the fast tier unless code/deep complexity signals are present.
- **soul guardrail** — `updateSoul` rejects edits to a `security` section input.
- **learnings auto-capture** — obvious user correction messages are now written into the learnings table.
- **retention + db hot paths** — added 90-day message cleanup at boot and cached prepared statements for hot message/usage writes.
- **llm resilience** — added an OpenRouter circuit-breaker response path after consecutive failures.
- **help command** — added `/help` telegram command.
- **version bump to 1.2.0** — updated `package.json` and health endpoint.

## 2026-02-16
### v1.1.3 — outgoing message deduplication

#### added

- **outgoing message deduplication** — `sendReply()` now checks `sentMessages` Set before sending. identical outgoing messages (same chatId + content hash via `Bun.hash()`) are skipped within a 5-minute window. prevents duplicate bot replies from retry logic or double calls.

---

## 2026-02-13
### v1.1.2 — reminder reliability + character consistency

fixes reminders silently failing outside active hours (8am–11pm) and the bot breaking character when apologizing.

#### fixed

- **reminders now fire 24/7** — `checkTasks()` was gated behind `isActiveHours()`, so any reminder set for nighttime (e.g. 1:19 AM) would silently never fire. scheduler checks are now outside the active hours gate; only the heartbeat respects quiet hours.
- **near-term reminder precision** — reminders set < 5 minutes out now get a precise `setTimeout` via `scheduleNudge()` instead of relying on the 30s poll interval. "remind me in 1 min" fires on time, not up to 30s late.
- **"done." fallback** — when the LLM returned empty text, the agent sent the literal string "done." which confused users. replaced with "aight that's handled." to stay in character.

#### changed

- **soul: error/apology guidance** — added 4 rules to `response.md` for handling mistakes in-character: own it casually, never apologize formally, stay lowercase, don't over-explain.
- **version bump to 1.1.2** — updated `package.json` and health endpoint.

### v1.1.1 — dev logging + emoji tuning + cleanup

small quality-of-life release. adds opt-in debug logging for the full message lifecycle, tones down emoji usage in soul files, and cleans up stale v1.0 references.

#### added

- **debug logging** — set `"debug": true` in config.json `features` to enable `[tag]` console logs across the entire message lifecycle: tier/intent classification, model selection, context compaction, model escalation, tool calls, token usage + cost, telegram message routing, STT/TTS, proactive ticks, memory operations. zero-cost when disabled.
- **`src/log.ts`** — tiny `log(tag, ...args)` helper. `enableDebug()` activates it on boot.

#### changed

- **soul emoji cleanup** — removed all 🧊 usage (was 3 occurrences). 🐻‍❄️ kept where identity matters (3 uses). added one 🐾 on protocol header. emojis now used sparingly.
- **version bump to 1.1.1** — updated `package.json`, health endpoint, soul default version, all file headers.
- **header cleanup** — removed "v1" from file header comments in `src/config.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `.env.example`.

### v1.1.0 — hardening + voice pipeline upgrade

hardening release. ships all 8 v1.1 roadmap items plus a full voice pipeline swap.

#### changed

- **voice STT: groq whisper → gemini 3 flash via openrouter** — eliminates a separate API key. STT now reuses the existing openrouter key. gemini handles audio natively as multimodal input (`input_audio` with base64 ogg).
- **voice TTS: openai tts-1 → cartesia sonic 3** — lower latency (~40ms), better voice quality. configurable voice id via `voice.cartesiaVoiceId` (defaults to `694f9389-aac1-45b6-b726-9d9369183238`).
- **voice-only reply** — voice messages now get voice replies only (no duplicate text message). falls back to text when TTS is unavailable.
- **config: voice keys replaced** — `voice.groqApiKey` + `voice.openaiApiKey` replaced by `voice.cartesiaApiKey` + `voice.cartesiaVoiceId`. env vars: `KODA_CARTESIA_API_KEY` + `KODA_CARTESIA_VOICE_ID` replace `KODA_GROQ_API_KEY` + `KODA_OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **message dedup by content hash** — switched from message_id-based dedup to `Bun.hash()` content hashing. identical messages with different IDs now correctly deduplicated. voice uses message_id hash (content unknown pre-transcription), photos hash caption.
- **telegram reconnect with exponential backoff** — `bot.start()` now retries with exponential backoff + jitter on connection failure. consecutive error tracking auto-restarts bot after 5 failures.
- **context compaction** — when tool step count exceeds 10, `prepareStep` splices older messages keeping last 6. prevents context window exhaustion on deep tool chains.
- **heartbeat structured parsing** — heartbeat now parses `- [ ]` / `- [x]` checkboxes from HEARTBEAT.md. only sends pending items with structured count to agent (e.g. "you have 3 pending tasks (2 completed)").

#### no-op

- **skill hot-reload** — marked done. `loadSkill()` already reads the file fresh every call, `listSkills()` scans directories every call. no cache to invalidate.

---

## 2026-02-13
### v1.0.1 — stability + safety patch

bugfix release focused on setup reliability, request isolation, scheduler delivery, and filesystem hardening.

#### fixed

- **setup/runtime env mismatch** — runtime now loads both `~/.koda/.env` and project `.env`, so `koda setup` works without manual env copying.
- **required key inconsistency** — setup now requires `KODA_SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY`, matching config validation.
- **request context race** — tools now use request-scoped context via `AsyncLocalStorage` to prevent cross-chat/user leakage under concurrency.
- **telegram proactive delivery** — scheduler reminders now send through Telegram when the task channel is telegram.
- **soul persistence** — `updateSoul` now writes changes back to `soul.md` instead of mutating in-memory only.
- **filesystem symlink escape** — write path validation now checks real paths of existing parents and blocks symlink writes outside workspace.
- **cron schedule validation** — invalid weekday/time inputs now fail fast instead of drifting into bad scheduling behavior.
- **exec portability** — shell execution is now platform-aware (`cmd.exe` on Windows, `sh` on Unix-like systems).
- **telegram dedup collisions** — dedup keys now include chat id + message id to avoid cross-chat false positives.
- **memory fallback targeting** — sqlite fallback recall now accepts the active session key so lookups hit the correct conversation history.
- **cli entrypoint** — `bun run src/cli.ts <command>` now executes commands directly (`koda` script is functional).

#### changed

- bumped version to **1.0.1** (`package.json`, CLI version output, health endpoint version).

### v1.0.0 — the rebuild

ground-up rewrite. threw away the over-engineered prototype, kept the good ideas, rebuilt everything from scratch.

#### added

- **3-tier llm routing** — fast/standard/deep replaces 4-tier simple/medium/complex/reasoning. rule-based keyword classifier instead of 8-dimension weighted scoring. cheaper, faster, predictable.
- **model escalation** — `prepareStep` callback automatically upgrades the model mid-conversation if the agent exceeds 5 tool steps on a lower tier. starts cheap, scales only when needed.
- **voice pipeline** — full voice I/O via telegram. groq whisper for speech-to-text, openai tts-1 for text-to-speech. raw `fetch()` calls, no sdk dependencies.
- **local code execution** — `Bun.spawn()` replaces E2B cloud sandboxes. auto-backgrounds processes after 10s timeout. blocked commands list for safety. process management (poll, stream logs, kill).
- **interactive cli** — `koda setup` wizard with @clack/prompts, `koda doctor` health checks with ora spinners, `koda upgrade` self-update from github releases, `koda version`.
- **learnings table** — sqlite table for storing corrections and preferences. persists across sessions.
- **closure-based tool context** — shared `toolContext` object set per-request, replacing AsyncLocalStorage threading.
- **health server** — `GET /health` endpoint on port 3000 for docker/railway health checks.

#### changed

- **architecture** — 12-stage middleware pipeline replaced by single `generateText` tool loop. the vercel ai sdk handles the entire agent loop via `stepCountIs(30)`.
- **message routing** — typed MessageBus replaced by direct `runAgent()` function calls from channels. no message bus, no pub/sub.
- **config** — 4-tier model config (simpleModel/mediumModel/complexModel/reasoningModel) replaced by 3-tier (fastModel/standardModel/deepModel). added voice keys (groqApiKey, openaiApiKey).
- **database** — dropped `task_attempts` and `task_outcomes` tables. kept 5 tables: messages, tasks, usage, learnings, state.
- **memory** — circuit breaker inlined into memory provider (3 failures in 60s trips). sqlite fallback searches messages table by keyword when supermemory is down.
- **tools** — memory tools renamed: addMemory to remember, searchMemories to recall. 8 tool modules instead of 9 capabilities with 28 tools.
- **soul** — simplified loader. no backup complexity, no version tracking. hot-reload via file watcher.
- **skills** — index-first loading. only skill names and descriptions go into the system prompt. full skill content loaded on demand.
- **proactive** — simplified tick loop. direct function calls instead of message bus dispatch. catch-up logic for missed reminders.
- **benchmarks** — adapted from 113 cases (many testing removed features) to 55 deterministic + 15 llm-judged cases. 100% pass rate. removed outcome, safety, and budget scorers.
- **telegram** — inline rate limiting and message dedup instead of separate middleware. voice message support. photo caption support.

#### removed

- **middleware pipeline** — the 12-stage `(ctx, next) => Promise<void>` pipeline. replaced by a single function.
- **MessageBus** — typed pub/sub message routing. channels now call functions directly.
- **AsyncLocalStorage** — context threading for request-scoped state. replaced by a simple closure object.
- **E2B sandbox** — cloud-based code execution. replaced by local `Bun.spawn()`.
- **4-tier routing** — 8-dimension weighted scoring classifier with complexity/ambiguity/technicality/scope/urgency/tool/interaction/creativity dimensions.
- **focus mode** — urgency detection and message holding system for non-urgent proactive messages.
- **outcome learning** — extraction of success/failure/partial signals from user feedback. deferred to v2.
- **budget scoring** — message importance scoring for context window management. deferred to v2.
- **safety detector** — prompt injection detection via keyword matching. deferred to v2.
- **onboarding stage** — first-message detection and welcome flow.
- **session stage** — conversation session management with idle timeouts.
- **context budget** — token budget allocation and message pruning.
- **`@supermemory/tools`** — unused dependency. we use `supermemory` client directly.
- **`e2b`** — cloud sandbox dependency.
- **12 CLI files** — custom terminal UI with gradients, typewriter effects, ASCII banners. replaced by 1 file with @clack/prompts.
- **`src/cli/embedded.ts`** — build-time asset bundling for compiled CLI binary.
- **stale docs** — ARCHITECTURE.md, SETUP.md, TOOLS.md, BENCHMARKS.md, CLI.md, README_SIMPLE.md. all referenced the old architecture.
